Hi, I’m @AndreiNM

👀 I’m interested in Cybersecurity, Linux, and IT Infrastructure.
🌱 I’m currently learning hands-on cybersecurity skills using platforms like TryHackMe and refining my knowledge in Linux through the CompTIA Linux+ and LPI Linux Essentials certifications.
💼 I started my IT journey in 2020 with zero knowledge, inspired by my brother and driven by a desire to change my life during the lockdown in the UK. Despite initial doubts about my capabilities, I embraced the challenge, balancing work with pursuing an undergraduate degree in Business Studies while earning several IT certifications.
🛠️ I’m looking to collaborate on real-world cybersecurity projects and any open-source initiatives where I can apply and expand my skills.
💼 I am actively seeking an entry-level position in cybersecurity where I can contribute my knowledge and grow further in the field.
